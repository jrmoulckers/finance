# Custom Copilot Agents — Finance

Custom agents are specialized AI personas defined in `.github/agents/`. Each agent has a specific role, set of tools, and boundaries that focus its expertise on a particular aspect of development.

## How Agents Work

1. Agent definitions live in `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md`
2. Each file contains YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools) and a Markdown body with detailed instructions
3. Copilot loads the relevant agent when invoked by name in chat (e.g., `@architect`)
4. The GitHub Copilot Coding Agent can also use these definitions when working on issues autonomously

## Available Agents

### `@architect` — System Architect

## Adding a New Agent

1. Create `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md` with YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: <agent-name>
   description: >
     Clear description of the agent's purpose and when to use it.
   tools:
     - read
     - edit
     - search
   ---
   ```
2. Write the Markdown body with: Mission, Expertise Areas, Key Responsibilities, and Boundaries
3. Update this document (`docs/ai/agents.md`) with the new agent's details
4. Test the agent by invoking it in Copilot Chat

## Best Practices

- **Invoke the right agent** — Use `@security-reviewer` for security reviews, not generic Copilot
- **Combine agents** — Ask `@architect` to design, then `@security-reviewer` to review
- **Trust but verify** — Agent output is a starting point; always review critically
- **Update agents** — As the project evolves, update agent instructions to reflect new patterns
