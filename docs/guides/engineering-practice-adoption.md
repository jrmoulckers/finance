# Adopting `jrmoulckers/engineering`

Status of finance's adoption of the centralized engineering practice repository. Tracking
issue: [#4029](https://github.com/jrmoulckers/finance/issues/4029).

Upstream: [`docs/adopting.md`](https://github.com/jrmoulckers/engineering/blob/main/docs/adopting.md).

## Done

- **Citations replace restated rules.** ADR-0002/0018/0022 cite `ENG-LOCAL-*`/`ENG-DATA-*`;
  ADR-0020 cites `ENG-OBS-001`–`007`; ADR-0023 cites `ENG-INT-003`/`ENG-SEC-007`;
  `security-architecture.md` cites `ENG-SEC-*`; `security-checklist.md` cites `ENG-SEC-006`;
  `performance-budget-architecture.md` and `guides/performance.md` cite `ENG-PERF-*` and
  `ENG-WEB-003`. `AGENTS.md` names the engineering repo as the authority and states the
  no-copy rule from ADR-0003.

  **Known gap in this pass: the diff was net-additive.** Citations were added, but the prose
  they cite was largely not deleted — each file was judged to carry local context (thresholds,
  platform specifics) beyond the ratified rule. That is defensible file by file and
  unsatisfying in aggregate, since removing duplication was the point. A second pass with a
  harder deletion bias is warranted once `practices/` has stabilised.

- **Every citation verified against `principles/index.json`.** All **28 distinct `ENG-*` IDs**
  cited across finance resolve to a real Ratified principle, and every parenthetical gloss
  matches the canonical `title` exactly. A wrong ID is worse than the restated prose it
  replaced, because it reads as authoritative while pointing at nothing — so the index, not
  memory, is the source. Re-run the check whenever citations are added:

  ```powershell
  $idx = Get-Content <engineering>\principles\index.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
  # compare each cited ID against ($idx.principles).id
  ```

- **ADR numbering reconciled.** See [`docs/architecture/README.md`](../architecture/README.md).
- **Workflow reuse assessed.** See
  [`docs/ops/workflow-reuse-assessment.md`](../ops/workflow-reuse-assessment.md). Action
  pinning already satisfies `GH-ACT-003` — 241/241 refs SHA-pinned.
- **`.npmrc` committed**, containing the `@jrmoulckers` scope-routing line and nothing else. It
  is inert until the scope is actually depended on; `npm ci` and `npm install` work normally
  with no token configured (verified).

  It deliberately carries **no `_authToken` line**. Interpolating `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` into a
  tracked file puts a credential-shaped string in version control, and when the variable is
  unset npm sends an _empty_ token rather than none — the registry then answers `401
unauthenticated: User cannot be authenticated with the token provided`, which points at a bad
  token when the real problem is a missing one. Credentials belong in the developer's
  user-level `~/.npmrc`, and in CI in the file `actions/setup-node` generates from
  `registry-url` + `scope`.

  It also routes **by scope only**. Replacing the default registry wholesale would break
  `npm audit` with `ERR_PNPM_AUDIT_ENDPOINT_NOT_EXISTS`, and no token fixes that. The routing
  rules and the measured audit egress are recorded in
  [`docs/security/supply-chain.md`](../security/supply-chain.md).

## Blocked: the shared toolchain presets

`@jrmoulckers/eslint-config`, `@jrmoulckers/prettier-config`, and `@jrmoulckers/tsconfig` are
published to **GitHub Packages, which requires authentication even to read**. The token
available to CI and to this repository's agents does not carry the `read:packages` scope:

```text
npm error code E403
npm error 403 Forbidden - GET https://npm.pkg.github.com/@jrmoulckers%2feslint-config
npm error Permission permission_denied: The token provided does not match expected scopes.
```

Granting a token is a human-gated operation. **The presets were deliberately not adopted
blind** — a lint config that cannot be executed locally would be verified for the first time
by CI on `main`.

### To unblock

1. Grant this repository read access to the packages from the `jrmoulckers/engineering`
   package settings, **or** create a classic PAT with `read:packages` and store it as the
   `PACKAGES_READ_TOKEN` repository secret. GitHub Packages accepts **classic PATs only** — a
   fine-grained token fails with the same `401` as no token at all, so this is worth getting
   right before debugging.
2. Developers put the token in their **user-level `~/.npmrc`**, never in the repository's:

   ```text
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<classic-pat-with-read-packages>
   ```

3. Add registry auth to every workflow that runs `npm ci`:

   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/setup-node@<sha>
     with:
       node-version: 22
       registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com
       scope: '@jrmoulckers'
   - run: npm ci
     env:
       NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGES_READ_TOKEN }}
   ```

   This applies to finance's own workflows, which install dependencies themselves. The
   **reusable** workflows in `jrmoulckers/.github` that run `npm ci` / `pnpm install` currently
   set no `registry-url`, no `scope`, and no `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`, and expose no input or secret to
   supply one — so a caller cannot fix this from its own side. That is being addressed upstream.

   Ordering consequence: **do not migrate a dependency-installing workflow onto a backbone
   reusable until both that fix and the token have landed.** It does not affect the workflows
   finance runs today, but it gates the `deploy-pages.yml` migration, which would otherwise
   start failing the moment `@jrmoulckers/*` enters the manifest.

4. Depend on **`^0.2.0`** for all three of `@jrmoulckers/eslint-config`, `@jrmoulckers/tsconfig`
   and `@jrmoulckers/prettier-config`. The React preset and `vite-react.json` — the two files
   finance actually needs — first shipped in `0.2.0`, as did `prettier-config`'s reversal to
   `proseWrap: 'preserve'`. On a `0.x` package a caret permits patch updates only, so `^0.1.0`
   resolves to `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0` and can never reach any of them.

   Worth stating as a method rather than a version bump: verify against the **resolved range**,
   not the working tree. Validating a preset through a `file:` link while committing a caret
   range that cannot reach it means the artifact tested and the artifact installed are different
   code. That recurs at every major boundary, not just this one.

### Then, for ESLint

Install the preset and reduce `eslint.config.mjs` to `base({ ignores, rules, extend })`.
Baseline for comparison: **the current config reports 0 problems across the repo**, so every
new finding is attributable to the preset.

What the shared `base()` adds: `eqeqeq` (`null: 'ignore'`), `eslint-config-prettier`,
`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` at `error` instead of `warn`, and `no-console` with
`allow: ['warn', 'error']`. Roughly **58 loose-equality sites across 36 files** exist today —
many are `== null`, which the rule's option permits, so the real count needs a run.

What must stay local, via `extend` / `ignores` / `rules`:

- The `finance/no-money-template-interpolation` and `finance/no-hardcoded-date-locale` plugin
  rules and their four path-scoped blocks.
- The `**/.gradle/**` ignore — KMP-specific, absent from the shared ignore set.
- `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports: off` plus the CommonJS globals for `tools/`,
  `scripts/`, `.vscode/extensions/`, and `**/webpack.config.d/**`.
- `no-console: off` for `services/**` and `tools/**`, which the preset's `toolingFiles` glob
  does not cover.

### Then, for Prettier

`.prettierrc.json` is byte-equivalent to the shared config on all seven keys. Adopt
`@jrmoulckers/prettier-config` at **`^0.2.0`**, which sets `proseWrap: 'preserve'` and
`printWidth: 96` for `*.md`. The 73-line `.prettierignore` is finance-specific and stays.

**Adopting the markdown override is a verified no-op here.** Finance already uses Prettier's
default `preserve`, so the only delta is `printWidth` 100 → 96, and under `preserve` that affects
only tables, lists and fences — not prose. Measured across every tracked markdown file:

| Metric                 | Value     |
| ---------------------- | --------- |
| Markdown files tracked | 592       |
| Files changed          | **0**     |
| Line churn             | **0 / 0** |

No reflow commit is needed.

The earlier `0.1.x` config set `proseWrap: 'always'`, which would have rewritten **528 of 592
files (89%)** — 36,249 added / 29,723 removed against 182,051 total markdown lines, roughly 36% of
every markdown line finance owns. Finance objected on that basis; the authority reversed to
`preserve` in `0.2.0` and cancelled the reflow fleet-wide. The reasoning that settled it was not
the one-time cost:

**`proseWrap: 'always'` destroys semantic line breaks**, silently, on every write. One sentence per
line is the technique that bounds line length without taxing edits, and Prettier cannot enforce
it — but `always` actively undoes it, while `preserve` is the setting that permits it. `preserve`
is therefore not better in itself; it is the only value under which the convention can survive.

**The merge-conflict axis does not discriminate between the two live options** and should not be
cited in either direction. Measured directly — two branches, each editing one sentence of a shared
paragraph, then `git merge`:

| Regime                         | Edits far apart | Edits adjacent |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| `always`                       | clean           | CONFLICT       |
| `preserve`, one long paragraph | **CONFLICT**    | CONFLICT       |
| `preserve` + semantic breaks   | clean           | CONFLICT       |

Conflict behaviour is governed by **line granularity, not wrapping policy**. `always` and semantic
breaks both produce roughly sentence-length lines and behave identically. Unbroken single-line
paragraphs are the genuinely bad case, because every concurrent edit collides on one line.
Adjacent edits conflict under every regime, since git needs an unchanged context line between
changes. So finance's original "`always` manufactures conflicts" argument was wrong, and so is the
converse — the real cost of `always` is the one above.

**Convention: semantic line breaks.** One sentence per line in new and substantially-edited prose.
Not enforced, not retrofitted, and not a reason to reflow existing files.

### Sealed and generated content

Reformatting is only safe where formatting carries no meaning. Finance's tree was audited for
content where it does. This audit stands regardless of the `proseWrap` outcome — it applies to any
future formatting change, which is why it is recorded rather than discarded once the reflow was
cancelled. Two classes exist and both are already handled by `.prettierignore`:

- **Sealed** — `**/vendor/@jrm/` (vendored verbatim from `jrmoulckers/studio`) and the
  studio-managed `.github/agents`, `.github/instructions`, `.github/prompts`, and `.github/skills`
  assets, which are generated and hash-checked upstream. Reformatting these would invalidate the
  hash that proves they match their source.
- **Unparseable** — `.kt`, `.kts`, `.swift`, `Caddyfile`, `.npmrc`, `*.env*`, `*.sql`.

**Golden and snapshot fixtures were checked specifically and need no exclusion**, which is worth
recording because the reason generalises. Finance has six fixture files —
`apps/windows/src/test/resources/narration-fixtures/{golden,snapshots}/*.json` and
`tools/ai-eval/golden-tasks/*.json` — and **every one is deserialised before comparison**
(`json.decodeFromString` then `assertEquals` on the data class; `JSON.parse` in `run-evals.js`).
The repository contains no `toMatchFileSnapshot`, no `toMatchSnapshot`, and no `.snap` files.

So the hazard is not "golden fixtures exist" but "golden fixtures are compared as bytes." A
parse-then-compare fixture is immune to reformatting by construction; a byte-compared one fails
as a false test failure far from its cause. Finance has none of the latter, and the audit is
recorded here so the next formatting change does not have to repeat it.

## Deliberately deferred

**`@jrmoulckers/tsconfig`.** `apps/web/tsconfig.json` is the repository's only tsconfig. Trial
run against the shared chain (`vite-react.json` → `vite-app.json` → `base.json`, resolved from
source): **2,691 diagnostics**, against a baseline of 0.

| Code                   | Count | Cause                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| TS2532 + TS18048       | 2,173 | `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` — possibly `undefined`     |
| TS2345 + TS2322        | 416   | same family, surfacing as `T \| undefined` mismatches |
| TS6133                 | 29    | `noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters`               |
| TS2769                 | 27    | no overload matches                                   |
| TS1484                 | 20    | `verbatimModuleSyntax` — needs `import type`          |
| TS2538, TS2488, TS2339 | 24    | index/iterator/property shapes                        |

**1,853 (69%) are in test files; 838 (31%) in production code.** The concentration is in import
parsers — `qif-parser.ts` (55), `csv-parser.ts` (45), `reconciliation.ts` (36),
`pdf-parser.ts` (34).

**Triage finding: the dominant shape is provably safe.** Sampling the highest-risk codes
(TS2538/TS2488) across production sites found no active crash. finance's diagnostics are
overwhelmingly `arr[i]` inside `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`, regex capture groups
behind a match guard, and `split('|')` destructuring of a key the same function constructed —
all in-bounds by construction, unprovable to the compiler.

The useful discriminator, since a raw count is not a risk signal:

> The dangerous shape is a read indexed by something **other than** the collection's own bounds
> check — zipping two collections by position, or indexing collection A by a value found in
> collection B. A read indexed by its own `length` guard is noise.

`reconciliation.ts:196` (`existing[exactCandidates[0]]`) is the one instance of the dangerous
shape found, and it is guarded by `exactCandidates.length === 1`.

This is a real migration and needs its own issue, but it is **mechanical, not bug-revealing**,
and should be sequenced accordingly. Fix at the call site with guards, never with `!` or `as`.

## Gaps to close upstream, in `jrmoulckers/engineering`

These are engineering-repo changes. Working around them locally would create exactly the
duplication this adoption removes.

1. **No React ESLint preset.** (Closed upstream in `eslint-config@0.2.0`+.) The package shipped
   `./base`, `./svelte`, and `./next` only. finance's
   web app is **React 19 + Vite, 2,301 `.ts`/`.tsx` files** — none of the three fit. `base()`
   carries no `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (rules-of-hooks, exhaustive-deps) and no `jsx-a11y`,
   both of which this app needs and on which its WCAG 2.2 AA obligations depend. Requesting
   `@jrmoulckers/eslint-config/react`.
2. **`tsconfig/vite-app.json` has no `jsx` setting** and sets `types: ['vite/client']` only. A
   React consumer needs `"jsx": "react-jsx"`. Requesting a `vite-react.json` variant. (Closed
   upstream in `tsconfig@0.2.0`.)
3. **`tsconfig/base.json` sets no `ignoreDeprecations`, which aborts the run on TypeScript 6.**
   finance is on **TypeScript 6.0.3**, where `baseUrl` is a hard error (`TS5101`), not a warning.
   A consumer that extends the shared chain while keeping `baseUrl` + `paths` — the ordinary
   shape for a path alias — gets **one config error and zero type diagnostics**, because the
   compiler exits before checking anything. That reads as "the preset works, we're clean."

   Either set `"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"` in `base.json`, or document that consumers must drop
   `baseUrl` and make `paths` tsconfig-relative (`"@/*": ["./src/*"]`), which is the better fix.
   Worth stating loudly given the adoption wave is measuring diagnostic counts right now.

4. **`vite-app.json`'s `types: ['vite/client']` replaces rather than merges.** `types` is not
   additive across `extends`, so any consumer with test globals silently loses them. finance had
   to restate `node`, `vitest/globals`, and `@testing-library/jest-dom` alongside `vite/client`.
   A note in `docs/adopting.md` would save every consumer the rediscovery.
5. **`practices/performance-budgets.md` covers no native or JVM profiling.** Its sections are
   delivery/runtime budgets and Lighthouse — yet `ENG-PERF-007` requires _platform-native_
   profiling. finance already documents Android Profiler + baseline profiles, Instruments +
   MetricKit + signposts, JFR + VisualVM + WPA, and a Gradle benchmark harness. That technique
   is general and belongs upstream.
6. **No native-platform principle area.** The 66 principles span 11 areas — API, ARCH, BUILD,
   DATA, INT, LOCAL, OBS, PERF, SEC, TEST, WEB. `WEB` covers browser frontends; **nothing covers
   native application surface.** Searching the whole principles corpus for `mobile|Android|iOS|
desktop|Kotlin|Swift|multiplatform` returns a single incidental match. finance ships **four**
   platforms, **three of them native** (Android, iOS, Windows/Compose Desktop), so only
   `apps/web` is addressed by a platform area at all.

   This compounds gap 3 rather than duplicating it: `ENG-PERF-007` demands platform-native
   profiling, the practice that would explain how is web-shaped, and there is no native area to
   host the obligation in the first place. Requesting an `ENG-NATIVE-*` (or `ENG-APP-*`) area.

7. **`scripts/check-citations.mjs` does not expand ID ranges.** The checker resolves literal IDs
   only, so a citation written as `` `ENG-OBS-001`–`ENG-OBS-007` `` is scanned as exactly two
   citations and the five in between are never verified. That is precisely where a
   wrong-meaning citation hides best: a range asserts something about every member while
   showing the reader only the endpoints. In this repository the ranges concealed five IDs
   (`ENG-OBS-002`–`006`, `ENG-DATA-002`) — all correct on manual check, but invisible to the
   tool that exists to check them. Requesting that the checker either expand `NNN`–`NNN` ranges
   within an area or warn that it cannot.

## Citation audit

Verified with `scripts/check-citations.mjs --review` at `v0.2.11`, run over all 804 markdown
files: **every ID valid, and every principle's true title matching the claim made about it.** The
wrong-meaning defect reported elsewhere in the org did not reach finance.

Two notes, because the exit code is not the result:

- **`ENG-ARCH-003` is cited here correctly**, as the obligation to keep durable decision
  records, in `docs/architecture/README.md`. It is one of the IDs miscited elsewhere, so it was
  checked directly rather than assumed.
- **Ranges were rewritten as explicit lists.** ADR-0002 and ADR-0020 previously cited
  `ENG-DATA-001`–`003` and `ENG-OBS-001`–`007`. Both are now enumerated with each principle's
  title inline, which brings five previously unverifiable IDs under the checker and removes the
  blind spot described in gap 7. Prefer enumerated citations over ranges for this reason.

Finance cites **nothing as the source** of its accessibility, test-colocation, or service-tier
requirements — there is no ratified principle for any of them. Those are finance commitments and
say so. Where a ratified principle bears on them _additively_, that is now stated as such rather
than omitted:

- `docs/guides/accessibility.md` and `docs/audits/accessibility-audit-wcag22.md` note that
  `ENG-PERF-009` (assurance precedence) forbids trading accessibility away for performance. It is
  not the source of the WCAG 2.2 AA commitment; it constrains what may be done to it.
- Test colocation is named as a finance convention; the obligation it serves is `ENG-TEST-003`
  (regression boundaries).

The distinction is worth stating precisely, because the two readings differ in what they license.
"Accessibility follows `ENG-PERF-009`" is false and would make the WCAG commitment look
negotiable by amending a principle finance does not own. "`ENG-PERF-009` additionally forbids
trading it away" is true and adds a constraint without relocating authority.

## Principles finance declines

**None.** All 66 apply or are inapplicable-but-not-contradicted; none conflict with finance's
architecture, so nothing is refused.

This was checked rather than assumed, and the expectation going in was the opposite — finance
diverges from the other repos more than any of them. The divergence turns out to be one of
**scale and platform count, not of contradicted premises**. Specific candidates examined and
cleared:

| Candidate       | Suspected tension                             | Verdict                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENG-API-003`   | Edge-first: logic runs on the client          | **Applies.** Supabase RLS enforces authorization server-side regardless of where computation happens.     |
| `ENG-API-002`   | Backend is sync-only, holds no business logic | **Applies.** Migrations + PowerSync rules are exactly the owned data contract it asks for.                |
| `ENG-WEB-004`   | Local SQLite outlives the session             | **Applies, strongly.** A PWA swapping assets under a running session is a live risk here.                 |
| `ENG-TEST-008`  | Mutation testing across ~5,516 files          | **Applies.** Aspirational at this scale, but scope is not contradiction.                                  |
| `ENG-LOCAL-001` | The one docket refused                        | **Affirmed.** docket's server is canonical; finance's client is. Finance is the principle's central case. |

Worth noting for the corpus: `ENG-LOCAL-001` being simultaneously the principle one repo refuses
outright and the principle another treats as foundational is a sign it is well-drawn, not
ambiguous — it makes a real claim that a repository can fail.

## Worth hoisting up

Finance-invented, generic, and absent from the shared layers:

- **The skip-with-success required-check pattern** — a path-filtered required check never
  reports status, leaving PRs permanently `BLOCKED`; gate inside the workflow instead. Generic
  Actions knowledge, so it belongs in `jrmoulckers/.github`.
- **The sensitive-data-logging grep guardrail** in `ci-lint.yml` — an executable check for
  `ENG-OBS-005`, which the practices layer currently states only as an obligation.
- **`.gitattributes` line-ending carve-out for Windows batch files.** The shared Prettier config
  sets `endOfLine: 'lf'`, which requires a `.gitattributes` to avoid `format:check` passing in CI
  and failing on every Windows checkout. finance already has one, and it goes further than the
  bare `* text=auto eol=lf` being recommended: it adds `*.bat`/`*.cmd text eol=crlf`. Forcing LF
  on batch files can break `cmd.exe` parsing, so the bare snippet trades one Windows-only failure
  for another. The carve-out belongs in the recommendation.
