## Done

- **Citations replace restated rules.** ADR-0002/0018/0022 cite `ENG-LOCAL-*`/`ENG-DATA-*`;
  ADR-0020 cites `ENG-OBS-001`–`007`; ADR-0023 cites `ENG-INT-003`/`ENG-SEC-007`;
  `security-architecture.md` cites `ENG-SEC-*`; `security-checklist.md` cites `ENG-SEC-006`;
  `performance-budget-architecture.md` and `guides/performance.md` cite `ENG-PERF-*` and
  `ENG-WEB-003`. `AGENTS.md` names the engineering repo as the authority and states the
  no-copy rule from ADR-0003.

  **Known gap in this pass: the diff was net-additive.** Citations were added, but the prose
  they cite was largely not deleted — each file was judged to carry local context (thresholds,
  platform specifics) beyond the ratified rule. That is defensible file by file and
  unsatisfying in aggregate, since removing duplication was the point. A second pass with a
  harder deletion bias is warranted once `practices/` has stabilised.

- **Every citation verified against `principles/index.json`.** All **28 distinct `ENG-*` IDs**
  cited across finance resolve to a real Ratified principle, and every parenthetical gloss
  matches the canonical `title` exactly. A wrong ID is worse than the restated prose it
  replaced, because it reads as authoritative while pointing at nothing — so the index, not
  memory, is the source. Re-run the check whenever citations are added:

  ```powershell
  $idx = Get-Content <engineering>\principles\index.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
  # compare each cited ID against ($idx.principles).id
  ```

- **ADR numbering reconciled.** See [`docs/architecture/README.md`](../architecture/README.md).
- **Workflow reuse assessed.** See
  [`docs/ops/workflow-reuse-assessment.md`](../ops/workflow-reuse-assessment.md). Action
  pinning already satisfies `GH-ACT-003` — 241/241 refs SHA-pinned.
- **`.npmrc` committed**, containing the `@jrmoulckers` scope-routing line and nothing else. It
  is inert until the scope is actually depended on; `npm ci` and `npm install` work normally
  with no token configured (verified).

  It deliberately carries **no `_authToken` line**. Interpolating `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` into a
  tracked file puts a credential-shaped string in version control, and when the variable is
  unset npm sends an _empty_ token rather than none — the registry then answers `401
unauthenticated: User cannot be authenticated with the token provided`, which points at a bad
  token when the real problem is a missing one. Credentials belong in the developer's
  user-level `~/.npmrc`, and in CI in the file `actions/setup-node` generates from
  `registry-url` + `scope`.

## Blocked: the shared toolchain presets

`@jrmoulckers/eslint-config`, `@jrmoulckers/prettier-config`, and `@jrmoulckers/tsconfig` are
published to **GitHub Packages, which requires authentication even to read**. The token
available to CI and to this repository's agents does not carry the `read:packages` scope:

```text
npm error code E403
npm error 403 Forbidden - GET https://npm.pkg.github.com/@jrmoulckers%2feslint-config
npm error Permission permission_denied: The token provided does not match expected scopes.
```

Granting a token is a human-gated operation. **The presets were deliberately not adopted
blind** — a lint config that cannot be executed locally would be verified for the first time
by CI on `main`.

### To unblock

1. Grant this repository read access to the packages from the `jrmoulckers/engineering`
   package settings, **or** create a classic PAT with `read:packages` and store it as the
   `PACKAGES_READ_TOKEN` repository secret. GitHub Packages accepts **classic PATs only** — a
   fine-grained token fails with the same `401` as no token at all, so this is worth getting
   right before debugging.
2. Developers put the token in their **user-level `~/.npmrc`**, never in the repository's:

   ```text
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<classic-pat-with-read-packages>
   ```

3. Add registry auth to every workflow that runs `npm ci`:

   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/setup-node@<sha>
     with:
       node-version: 22
       registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com
       scope: '@jrmoulckers'
   - run: npm ci
     env:
       NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PACKAGES_READ_TOKEN }}
   ```

   This applies to finance's own workflows, which install dependencies themselves. The
   **reusable** workflows in `jrmoulckers/.github` that run `npm ci` / `pnpm install` currently
   set no `registry-url`, no `scope`, and no `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`, and expose no input or secret to
   supply one — so a caller cannot fix this from its own side. That is being addressed upstream.

   Ordering consequence: **do not migrate a dependency-installing workflow onto a backbone
   reusable until both that fix and the token have landed.** It does not affect the workflows
   finance runs today, but it gates the `deploy-pages.yml` migration, which would otherwise
   start failing the moment `@jrmoulckers/*` enters the manifest.

### Then, for ESLint

Install the preset and reduce `eslint.config.mjs` to `base({ ignores, rules, extend })`.
Baseline for comparison: **the current config reports 0 problems across the repo**, so every
new finding is attributable to the preset.

What the shared `base()` adds: `eqeqeq` (`null: 'ignore'`), `eslint-config-prettier`,
`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` at `error` instead of `warn`, and `no-console` with
`allow: ['warn', 'error']`. Roughly **58 loose-equality sites across 36 files** exist today —
many are `== null`, which the rule's option permits, so the real count needs a run.

What must stay local, via `extend` / `ignores` / `rules`:

- The `finance/no-money-template-interpolation` and `finance/no-hardcoded-date-locale` plugin
  rules and their four path-scoped blocks.
- The `**/.gradle/**` ignore — KMP-specific, absent from the shared ignore set.
- `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports: off` plus the CommonJS globals for `tools/`,
  `scripts/`, `.vscode/extensions/`, and `**/webpack.config.d/**`.
- `no-console: off` for `services/**` and `tools/**`, which the preset's `toolingFiles` glob
  does not cover.

### Then, for Prettier

`.prettierrc.json` is byte-equivalent to the shared config on all seven keys. Adopt it for
those, and **exclude the shared markdown override** (`proseWrap: 'always'`, `printWidth: 96`).
The 73-line `.prettierignore` is finance-specific and stays.

The override was measured rather than assumed. Of 592 markdown files, 585 carry prose and
**399 would be reflowed**. The one-time reflow is not the objection; the recurring cost is.
The same one-word insertion into the same paragraph, by `git diff --numstat`:

| Regime               | Changed lines |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| `preserve` (current) | 1 / 1         |
| `always` at 96       | 5 / 5         |

Hard wrapping rewrites a whole paragraph for a one-word edit, because the insertion cascades
the rewrap down every following line. That is a permanent five-fold diff amplification on doc
edits: the real change hides among rewrapped lines during review, and two branches touching
one paragraph now conflict where they otherwise would not.

Stated fairly, `preserve` has a real cost of its own — it permits unbounded long lines, which
read badly in a terminal and in side-by-side diffs. The technique that avoids both is
**semantic line breaks**: one sentence per line, which bounds line length while keeping edits
to a single line. Prettier cannot enforce it, so it is a convention rather than a setting.

This was raised upstream rather than handled with a local override, since diverging locally is
the duplication this adoption exists to remove. **Consequence: the previously-planned 590-file
reflow does not happen.**

## Deliberately deferred

**`@jrmoulckers/tsconfig`.** `apps/web/tsconfig.json` is the repository's only tsconfig, and
the shared base adds `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noUnusedLocals`,
`noUnusedParameters`, `moduleDetection: force`, `noImplicitOverride`, and
`noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`; `vite-app.json` adds `checkJs`. Against **2,301 `.ts`/`.tsx`
files** that is a multi-thousand-diagnostic migration, not a config swap. It needs its own
issue.

## Gaps to close upstream, in `jrmoulckers/engineering`

These are engineering-repo changes. Working around them locally would create exactly the
duplication this adoption removes.

1. **No React ESLint preset.** The package ships `./base`, `./svelte`, and `./next`. finance's
   web app is **React 19 + Vite, 2,301 `.ts`/`.tsx` files** — none of the three fit. `base()`
   carries no `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (rules-of-hooks, exhaustive-deps) and no `jsx-a11y`,
   both of which this app needs and on which its WCAG 2.2 AA obligations depend. Requesting
   `@jrmoulckers/eslint-config/react`.
2. **`tsconfig/vite-app.json` has no `jsx` setting** and sets `types: ['vite/client']` only. A
   React consumer needs `"jsx": "react-jsx"`. Requesting a `vite-react.json` variant.
3. **`practices/performance-budgets.md` covers no native or JVM profiling.** Its sections are
   delivery/runtime budgets and Lighthouse — yet `ENG-PERF-007` requires _platform-native_
   profiling. finance already documents Android Profiler + baseline profiles, Instruments +
   MetricKit + signposts, JFR + VisualVM + WPA, and a Gradle benchmark harness. That technique
   is general and belongs upstream.
4. **No native-platform principle area.** The 66 principles span 11 areas — API, ARCH, BUILD,
   DATA, INT, LOCAL, OBS, PERF, SEC, TEST, WEB. `WEB` covers browser frontends; **nothing covers
   native application surface.** Searching the whole principles corpus for `mobile|Android|iOS|
desktop|Kotlin|Swift|multiplatform` returns a single incidental match. finance ships **four**
   platforms, **three of them native** (Android, iOS, Windows/Compose Desktop), so only
   `apps/web` is addressed by a platform area at all.

   This compounds gap 3 rather than duplicating it: `ENG-PERF-007` demands platform-native
   profiling, the practice that would explain how is web-shaped, and there is no native area to
   host the obligation in the first place. Requesting an `ENG-NATIVE-*` (or `ENG-APP-*`) area.

## Principles finance declines

**None.** All 66 apply or are inapplicable-but-not-contradicted; none conflict with finance's
architecture, so nothing is refused.

This was checked rather than assumed, and the expectation going in was the opposite — finance
diverges from the other repos more than any of them. The divergence turns out to be one of
**scale and platform count, not of contradicted premises**. Specific candidates examined and
cleared:

| Candidate       | Suspected tension                             | Verdict                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENG-API-003`   | Edge-first: logic runs on the client          | **Applies.** Supabase RLS enforces authorization server-side regardless of where computation happens.     |
| `ENG-API-002`   | Backend is sync-only, holds no business logic | **Applies.** Migrations + PowerSync rules are exactly the owned data contract it asks for.                |
| `ENG-WEB-004`   | Local SQLite outlives the session             | **Applies, strongly.** A PWA swapping assets under a running session is a live risk here.                 |
| `ENG-TEST-008`  | Mutation testing across ~5,516 files          | **Applies.** Aspirational at this scale, but scope is not contradiction.                                  |
| `ENG-LOCAL-001` | The one docket refused                        | **Affirmed.** docket's server is canonical; finance's client is. Finance is the principle's central case. |

Worth noting for the corpus: `ENG-LOCAL-001` being simultaneously the principle one repo refuses
outright and the principle another treats as foundational is a sign it is well-drawn, not
ambiguous — it makes a real claim that a repository can fail.

## Worth hoisting up

Finance-invented, generic, and absent from the shared layers:

- **The skip-with-success required-check pattern** — a path-filtered required check never
  reports status, leaving PRs permanently `BLOCKED`; gate inside the workflow instead. Generic
  Actions knowledge, so it belongs in `jrmoulckers/.github`.
- **The sensitive-data-logging grep guardrail** in `ci-lint.yml` — an executable check for
  `ENG-OBS-005`, which the practices layer currently states only as an obligation.
- **`.gitattributes` line-ending carve-out for Windows batch files.** The shared Prettier config
  sets `endOfLine: 'lf'`, which requires a `.gitattributes` to avoid `format:check` passing in CI
  and failing on every Windows checkout. finance already has one, and it goes further than the
  bare `* text=auto eol=lf` being recommended: it adds `*.bat`/`*.cmd text eol=crlf`. Forcing LF
  on batch files can break `cmd.exe` parsing, so the bare snippet trades one Windows-only failure
  for another. The carve-out belongs in the recommendation.
